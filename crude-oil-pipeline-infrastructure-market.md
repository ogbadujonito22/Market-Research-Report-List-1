<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude oil pipeline infrastructure market consists of two primary types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines transport large volumes of crude oil over long distances from production sites to refineries or storage facilities. These pipelines are high-capacity and span thousands of miles. In contrast, gathering pipelines collect smaller volumes of crude oil from multiple production wells and transport it to a central hub or terminal for further processing or transmission. This structure ensures efficient movement and management of oil resources.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pipeline Infrastructure Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude oil pipeline infrastructure market encompasses both onshore and offshore applications, essential for the efficient transportation of crude oil. Onshore pipelines facilitate the movement of crude oil from extraction sites to refineries and storage facilities, often spanning vast distances across land. Offshore pipelines, conversely, transport oil directly from underwater drilling sites to onshore processing facilities, navigating complex marine environments. Both infrastructures are critical for ensuring a steady supply of crude oil, supporting global energy demands and economic stability.</p></p>
