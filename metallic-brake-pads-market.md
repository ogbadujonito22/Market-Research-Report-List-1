<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metallic brake pads market includes two primary types: semi-metallic and low metallic NAO (non-asbestos organic) brake pads. Semi-metallic brake pads are composed of a mix of metal fibers and other materials, offering excellent heat dissipation and durability, making them ideal for high-performance vehicles. Low metallic NAO brake pads, on the other hand, contain fewer metal fibers, providing quieter operation and lower dust generation while maintaining effective braking performance. Each type caters to specific vehicle needs and driver preferences.</p></p>
