<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dechlorinator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfur Dioxide</li><li>Sulfite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dechlorinator market, primarily driven by water treatment needs, features two main types: sulfur dioxide and sulfite. Sulfur dioxide is often used for its effective chlorination removal in drinking water and wastewater applications, reacting with chlorine to form sulfites, which are then further converted into non-toxic compounds. Sulfite, on the other hand, is utilized directly as a reducing agent, offering a more immediate method for dechlorination, particularly in industrial processes, food preservation, and aquaculture.</p></p>
