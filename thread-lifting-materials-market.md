<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thread Lifting Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPDO</li><li>PCL</li><li>PLLA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thread lifting materials in the market primarily include polydioxanone (PDO), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polylactic acid (PLLA). PDO threads are absorbable sutures that provide skin tightening and rejuvenation with results lasting 6-12 months. PCL threads offer longer-lasting effects, up to 24 months, due to slower absorption, making them suitable for deeper tissue lifting. PLLA threads not only lift but also stimulate collagen production, leading to gradual skin improvement over time, typically lasting 12-18 months. Each offers unique benefits tailored to patient needs.</p></p>
