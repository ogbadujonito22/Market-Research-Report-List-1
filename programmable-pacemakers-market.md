<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The programmable pacemakers market features mainly two types: single chamber and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers stimulate one heart chamber, typically the right ventricle, suitable for conditions like bradycardia. In contrast, dual chamber pacemakers engage both the atrium and ventricle, maintaining optimal heart rhythm and synchrony, which benefits patients with more complex arrhythmias. The choice between these types depends on the patient's specific cardiac needs, driving demand and growth in the pacemaker market.</p></p>
